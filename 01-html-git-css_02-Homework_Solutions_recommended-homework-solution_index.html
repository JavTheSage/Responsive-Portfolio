      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Javier Villegas Bautista, a 20 year old male originally from Dana Point, California. I am currently
          taking a coding boot camp program at UCI to attain the knowledge and skillset to become a web developer. After
          graduating from Dana Hills High School, I took several general ed classes at Saddleback Community College but did
          not settle on any favorable majors while there. After searching across the world (wide web) for a purpose, I
          stumbled upon UCI's coding boot camp and was hooked in by its glowing reviews. In pursuit of a useful skillset I
          set out on a journey to attend this program and was soon tasked with making this portfolio site as homework. And
          although it is shoddier than a shack built with twigs it is a WIP with more to add to it as the program goes on.</p>
